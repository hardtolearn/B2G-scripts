This repository holds the scripts that we use to make building B2G easier.  The majority
of this repostiory used to be contained in github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G but is now stored
in an external repository to make it possible to set up a full B2G build environment
using only the repo tool.  To make a script appear in the root of the B2G source tree,
make sure that the file is <copyfile>'d appropriately in the appropriate manifest
